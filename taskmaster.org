use GetYAMLValues( is_modified )
** killsig
sanity check

what does process_return_val do ? nothing
** start umask
single function call ?
** start path
single function call ?-> chdir()
** additional env
single function call ? execv() -> execve() + add new values to envp arg
** time to start sanity check

See the status of all the programs described in the config file ("status" command)
** Reload the configuration file without stopping the main program
** Stop the main program
* the configuration file must allow the user to specify the following, for each program that is to be supervised:
** The command to use to launch the program
** The number of processes to start and keep running
** Whether to start this program at launch or not
** Whether the program should be restarted always, never, or on unexpected exits only
** Which return codes represent an "expected" exit status
** How long the program should be running after it’s started for it to be considered successfully started"
** How many times a restart should be attempted before aborting
** Which signal should be used to stop (i.e. exit gracefully) the program
** How long to wait after a graceful stop before killing the program
** Options to discard the program’s stdout/stderr or to redirect them to files
** Environment variables to set before launching the program
** A working directory to set before launching the program
** An umask to set before launching the program
